To help you and your partner, I have compiled this comprehensive Project Execution Report. 
You can use this to keep your development on track, and then copy the "Final Report" section 
into a document to save as a PDF for your portfolio. 
📑 PART 1: Project Execution & Workload 
(The "Plan") 
Since you are both second-year students, the goal is to balance learning with delivery. Here is 
how you should split the work from January to March. 
Workload Division 
Phase 
Partner A (AI Engine & 
Logic) 
Partner B (Systems & 
Interface) 
Jan: Foundation 
Setup PDF parser 
(PyMuPDF) and text 
chunking logic. 
Setup ChromaDB and 
write scripts to 
store/retrieve vectors. 
Feb: Intelligence 
Build the LangGraph 
"Reasoning Loop" (Search 
-> Verify). 
Build the FastAPI backend 
to handle requests 
between AI and UI. 
Mar: Multimodal 
Integrate Whisper (Voice) 
and Llama Vision 
(Images). 
Design the Streamlit 
dashboard and Dockerize 
the app. 
🛠️ PART 2: Amateur-to-Pro Skill Matrix 
Don't worry about being an amateur; these are the specific "mini-skills" you need to pick up. 
The "Survival" Skills (Learning Path) 
1.​ Python Mastery: Focus on Dictionaries, List Comprehensions, and JSON (AI speaks in 
JSON). 
2.​ RAG Logic: Learn why we "chunk" data (LLMs have a memory limit). 
3.​ Prompt Engineering: Instead of "Tell me about X," learn to write: "You are a medical 
expert. Using ONLY the provided context, answer X. If unsure, say you don't know." 
4.​ Version Control (Git): Essential for a team of two so you don't overwrite each other's 
code. 
📝 PART 3: The Final Project Report (PDF 
Content) 
Copy the section below into a Word/Doc file and "Export to PDF" to create your formal report. 
PROJECT REPORT: MediSight Multimodal AI Agent 
Objective: To develop an autonomous AI agent capable of synthesizing medical research 
from text, diagrams, and voice queries. 
1. Problem Statement 
Medical researchers spend hours manually cross-referencing PDFs, charts, and audio notes. 
MediSight AI automates this by providing a unified, multimodal RAG interface that ensures 
100% citation accuracy. 
2. Technical Architecture 
●​ Orchestration: LangGraph for stateful reasoning. 
●​ Vector Database: ChromaDB for semantic retrieval. 
●​ Models: Llama 3.2 (Text), Llama 3.2 Vision (Images), OpenAI Whisper (Audio). 
●​ Infrastructure: Dockerized FastAPI backend with a Streamlit frontend. 
3. Key Features 
●​ Multimodal Input: Supports .pdf, .jpg/png, and .mp3/wav. 
●​ Agentic Reasoning: Self-correcting retrieval loops to reduce hallucinations. 
●​ Verification: Automatic source-citation for every claim made by the AI. 
4. System Evaluation (Amateur Benchmarking) 
We utilized the RAGAS framework to score our system on: 
●​ Faithfulness: Is the answer derived solely from the documents? 
●​ Relevancy: Does the answer actually address the user's question? 
🚀 PART 4: Internship Targets (Summer 
2026) 
Since you are in India, apply to these specific programs between February and March 2026: 
1.​ Google STEP Internship: Specifically for 2nd-year students. Your "Multimodal" project 
will put you in the top 5% of applicants. 
2.​ Microsoft Research (MSR) India: They hire "Research Fellows." Your focus on 
LangGraph and citations is exactly what they look for. 
3.​ IBM SkillsBuild (Virtual): A 6-week AIML internship officially listed on the AICTE Portal 
starting in January/February. 
4.​ Startups (Bangalore/Remote): 
○​ Sarvam AI: Focuses on Indian-language LLMs. 
○​ Yellow.ai: Specializes in AI Agents (like your LangGraph project). 
○​ Skit.ai: Perfect if you emphasize the Whisper/Voice part of your project. 
Would you like me to draft a custom "Project Summary" for your LinkedIn profile so you 
can start building a reputation before you finish the project?

3. Prerequisite Checklist 
Before you start the project on January 1st, make sure you both have these "Basics" 
ready: 
●​ Python: You should know how to use pip install, handle JSON files, and write 
try-except blocks. 
●​ GitHub: Create a shared repository. Learn how to push, pull, and handle 
branches. 
●​ API Access: Sign up for a Google AI Studio account (for free Gemini API keys) or 
Groq (for super-fast Llama 3 access). 
 
Week 1 (Jan 1-7) Action Plan: 
1.​ Both: Watch the first 30 minutes of a LangGraph Tutorial to understand the 
"Graph" concept. 
2.​ Member A: Take the DeepLearning.AI "Agentic RAG" short course. 
3.​ Member B: Set up the GitHub repo and a basic "Hello World" Python 
environment.
